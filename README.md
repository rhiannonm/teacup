# teacup

DELICATE, you must hold it as if it will crumble beneath you
DAINTY, you become softer inside like a silky sheet
DELICIOUS, you sip delicatley the tea for which you desire
DEVOUR, your last sip like a child eating ice cream
DANCE, you sway deeply inside as the rushing tea becomes the river in your veins
